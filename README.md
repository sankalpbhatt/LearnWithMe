# LearnWithMe â€“ Java Concepts Playground

**LearnWithMe** is a hands-on repository designed to accompany my YouTube tutorials and demonstrate core Java concepts introduced in Java 8 and beyond.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

###  Current Example
- **[Record Classes](https://github.com/sankalpbhatt/LearnWithMe/tree/main/src/main/java/org/example/record)**
    - Demonstrates use of both final and non-final record examples.
    - Shows how Java automatically provides `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.
    - Includes constructor chaining for default values or validation.
- **[Sealed Classes](https://github.com/sankalpbhatt/LearnWithMe/tree/main/src/main/java/org/example/sealed)**
    - Demonstrates use of sealed classes.
    - Shows how to extend sealed classes for `final` and `non-sealed`.
- **[Optional](https://github.com/sankalpbhatt/LearnWithMe/tree/main/src/main/java/org/example/optional)**
    - Demonstrates use of Optional. How it is created and used.
    - Shows when to use `Optional.of` and `Optional.ofNullable`.

###  Coming Soon
Stay tuned! More topic-focused examples are on the way, such as:
- Lambdas & Functional Interfaces (Java 8)
- Streams API
- Default & static methods in interfaces
- Local variable type inference (`var`)
- Text Blocks (multiline string literals)
- Switch Expressions & Pattern Matching (Java 14â€“16+)
- And more!

##  Why This Repository Exists

- To **supplement my YouTube tutorials** with ready-to-run code examples.
- To serve as a go-to **learning resource** for Java learners and interview prep.
- To demonstrate **clean, modern Java coding techniques** that reduce boilerplate and embrace best practices.
